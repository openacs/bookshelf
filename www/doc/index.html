<h3>Why</h3>

<p>
  I wrote this bookshelf package for my own web site at <a
  href="http://www.pinds.com/">pinds.com</a>. For background
  information, please visit <a
  href="http://www.pinds.com/download/">http://www.pinds.com/download</a>.
</p>

<h3>Download</h3>

<p>
  The latest version lives in the <a
  href="http://openacs.org">OpenACS</a> CVS repository.
</p>

<h3>Getting started</h3>

<p>
  Install the package on your system, mount a new instance somewhere
  on the site map, make sure you have admin permission on the
  instance, and then visit the URL where you mounted it. Now you can
  add your first book.
</p>

<p>
  It's meant to support both single-user publish-to-the-world style
  bookshelf, and a collaboratively maintained bookshelf for members of
  a community.
</p>

<h3>Putting it on some other page</h3>

<p>
  If you want to inlcude your bookshelf on, say, your blog page, you
  can get it in two versions:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    &lt;include src="/packages/bookshelf/www/bookshelf-include"&gt;
    gives you the full version with reviews and all.
  </li>
  <li>
    &lt;include
    src="/packages/bookshelf/www/bookshelf-titles-include"&gt; gives
    you the short version which just lists the titles.
  </li>
</ul>


<h3>Technical Info</h3>

<p>
  The package fully supports multiple instances, i.e., you can mount
  several instances in your site map, and they'll stay properly
  isolated from each other.
</p>

<p>
  Only supports PostgreSQL (please do port to Oracle if you want to).
</p>
